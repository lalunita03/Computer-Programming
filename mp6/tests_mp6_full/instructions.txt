Version 11/17: Added an additional test_isolated_mp6_ab.py
to help students test functions/methods in isolated before testing
Part D (create_SC, create_BCC, create_FCC) and import/export functionality
in Part C.

To run these tests, make sure your mp6 has the following structure:

mp6/
  atom.py
  lattice.py
  lattice_client.py
  test_lattice.py
  test_isolated_mp6_ab.py
  student_files/
  test_files/
    aluminum_fcc_out.xyz
    iron_bcc_out.xyz
    plonium_sc_out.xyz

With your terminal located at /path/to/mp6/ (e.g. typing ls will display the py files above)
run:

pytest test_isolated_mp6_ab.py
pytest test_lattice.py

This will test your programs and generate 3 output files in student_files for you,
and compare them with our provided out files.

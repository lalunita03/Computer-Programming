CS 1 22fa Final Exam
Part A: Pitfalls
Student Name: Lea Grohmann

Part A.1: Syntax Errors
0. Line 1 has a syntax error for putting quotes around the second parameter
   which is syntax for a string value, not a function argument. The valid
   syntax required for the function header on Line 1 replaces 'lst' with lst.
1. Line 13 is missing a colon at the end of the line. This is supposed to be
   the condiitions for the while loop but the while loop won't work without
   the colon. The valid syntax requires a colon at the end of the line.
2. Line 17 has an indentation error. elif is indented too far. The valid
   syntax requires elif to be the same indentation as the header of the if
   statement, one tab in front of the elif should be removed and one tab in
   Lines 18, 19, and 20 should be removed as well.
3. Line 17 elif should be followed by a condition but it is not so there is an
   error. The valid syntax reqires `elif` to be replaced by `else`
4. Line 8 has an error because nothing should follow try. Also that's not how
   try is used. The valid syntax requires `try` to be replaced by `if`. Since
   that is what the user seems to be trying to do.
5. Line 14 used a single equal sign inside the if statement header. Single equal
   signs are used to assign variables not to check if two things are equal. The
   valid syntax requires `=` to be replaced by `==`.

Part A.2: Semantic Errors
0. Line 25 has a semantic error due to adding an unspecified '.txt' suffix
   when reading the file. While this is valid syntax, the function specifies
   that the file is read as given, without adding suffixes.
1. Line 31 split() doesn't actually modify the variable words itself. So words
   would still be the same string and then the for loop in the next line would
   just iterate over the characters in the string words which is not what we
   expect it to do. To fix this we would need to create a new variable such as
   this `words_list = words.split()` and then in Line 32 we would have to replaced
   `words` by `words_list`.
2. Line 34 instead of using += we need to use append becuase += adds every single
   character of the word as a seperate element to the list rather than adding the
   word itself as an element.
3. Line 36 we are already looping through the lines of the file setting line equal
   to file.readline() at the and of the for loop will result in us skipping every
   other line which is not what we want. So we can just delete line 36.
4. Line 9 we need the is_palindrome() function to return a boolean but the function
   is just printing it. We need to replace `print(lst == lst.reverse())` by
   `return lst == lst.reverse()`
5. Line 1 the function should take an argument replace `is_palindrome() by
   `is_palindrome(s)`. input() takes input from the terminal which is not what we
   want so we can delete this line.

Part A.3: Style (Design Flaw) Errors
0. Both Lines 7 and 9 have style issues _specific to inline comment spacing_;
   there should be a space before (if next to code) and after # for 
   inline comments.
1. Lines 3, 4 and 5 are missing a space before the equal sign
2. Lines 3, 4 and 5 are missing a space after the equal sign
3. Line 2 Docstrings should use triple quotes """running total of evens""" not single
4. Line 8 there should be a space before anf after the `==`
5. Line 11 and 12 this is unnessacary code since its not doing anything so we can
   delete it.
